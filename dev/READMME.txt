    AppRoot holds all global state and passes down props/setters.

    CanvasEditor renders from layers, manages selections, user transforms.

    LayerList shows/controls layer order and selection.

    LayerToolbar and StampPicker trigger “add layer” events.

    ExportPanel triggers export flow using current state.
